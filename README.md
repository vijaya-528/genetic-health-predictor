# AI-Powered Genetic Health Predictor from Family Tree

This project identifies hereditary health risks by analyzing multigenerational family medical history.  
It constructs a digital family tree and applies machine learning + NLP to detect patterns in disease inheritance.

## âœ¨ Features
- Build and visualize family tree with health data
- Predict hereditary risk for diseases (diabetes, heart disease, cancer, etc.)
- Extract health data from unstructured medical records (NLP)
- Generate personalized genetic risk report with recommendations

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack (Planned)
- **Frontend:** Angular / React
- **Backend:** Python (Flask/Django/FastAPI)
- **ML/NLP:** Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch, spaCy / Hugging Face
- **Database:** MongoDB / PostgreSQL

## ðŸš€ Future Enhancements
- Integration with wearable health devices
- Real-time health data updates
- Advanced visualization of inheritance patterns
